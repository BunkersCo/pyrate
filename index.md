Guide for setting up Raspberry Pyrate Radio Box

# PyrateRadio Setup

Step by Step guide for running PyrateRadio Box on Raspberry Pi 

## Getting Ready

You will need:

- Raspberry PI, Keyboard and Mouse

- 8 GB SD card (Minimum Size)

## Install the ISO

Copy the ISO onto your SD card.  Pop in SD card and boot up the Pyrate Box

## Post Installation

In dashboard, check for updates in player dashboard

## Limitations

There is no local mail server configured. This prevents "forgot password" and "create new account" (on the welcome screen) from working since they require confirmation emails. You can create accounts using admin -> user management once logged in instead.

- Allowed Senders should be: "Only addresses in my domains"

- For authentication, limit to the server IP or set up a username/password ("Require SMTP Authentication")

- "Require TLS Encryption" is also a good idea.
